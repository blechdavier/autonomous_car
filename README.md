# autonomous_car

## What

1:10 scale autonomous car powered by Raspberry Pi 5, Arduino Nano Every, Rplidar A1M8, and too many wires.

## When

Fridays during school 2023-2024, and whenever I'm free outside of school.

## Where

This project is designed to navigate indoor novel environments - think warehouse or supply chain.

## Why

- To build my skills mechanically and with control systems.
- I think autonomous robotics are super cool and they're probably going to be more prevalent in the near future.

## How

Software from scratch in Rust, structurally designed in Onshape, held together by a little too much hot glue.
